in place in the battle-app package.

### Requirements
- Styling - All styling must be done using styled-jsx. See Index.tsx for an example.
- Layout - All layout should be done using either flex box or grid layouts.
- TypeScript - All code must be written in TypeScript.
- Components - All React components must be functional components.
- Data Driven - Use the Questions API to retrieve the content for the questions displayed. A variable amount questions should be accounted for.  See Index.tsx for an example.
- Response Submissions - The answers selected by the user should be collected and POSTed to the Questions endpoint when the user presses the "Let's rock n' roll" button at the end of onboarding.
- Minimal Decencies - You are not permitted to install any additional npm packages.
- Animations - The transition between questions should be animated
- Responsiveness - The interface must be responsive. The provided Invision design is laid out for desktop. It is your responsibility to adjust to layout for mobile devices. Falling back to a vertically stacked layout is preferred.
